Gatsby can use Markdown files to create pages in your site. You add plugins to read and understand folders with Markdown files and from them create pages automatically.

Here are the steps Gatsby follows for making this happen.

1. Read files into Gatsby from the filesystem
2. Transform Markdown to HTML and frontmatter to data
3. Add a Markdown file
4. Create a page component for the Markdown files
5. Create static pages using Gatsbyâ€™s Node.js createPage API
